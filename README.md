# Websockets example

Simple real-time chatting app to demonstrate how to use websockets and Socket.io's library on both backend and frontend.

## Running the app

Install the backend dependencies and start the server, then install the frontend dependencies and start the local development server:
```bash
cd backend/
npm install
npm start
cd ../frontend/
npm install
npm start
```

You will have a backend server running at port 3001, and a React frontend running at port 3000. On your browser, open several tabs to test the real-time chat between multiple clients.
